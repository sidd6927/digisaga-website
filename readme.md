## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getastrothemes/folex-lite-astro.git
cd folex-lite-astro
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── .vscode/
├── public/
├── scripts/
├── src/
│ ├── assets/
│ ├── config/
│ ├── content/
│ ├── i18n/
│ ├── layouts/
│ ├── lib/
│ ├── pages/
│ ├── styles/
│ ├── types/
│ ├── content.config.ts
│ └── env.d.ts
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .markdownlint.json
├── .prettierrc
├── astro.config.mjs
├── netlify.toml
├── vercel.json
├── vercel.sh
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollectionCTM()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
